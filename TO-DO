DONE    word length bonus         
DONE    dict include 3 letter words 
DONE    word completion or arrows or both (box positioning using pos_hint) NO ARROWS THOUGH... NOT NECESSARY(?)
DONE    randomization of letters and amount of vowels?(4:3, cons:vowel) (list of 	  combines letters in ratio to randomly choose from)
DONE    removing words
DONE    REMOVE RED THINGS!!!
DONE    changed rows to columns
DONE    added color to word hint, yellow is a partial word, green is a whole word
DONE    moved layout to .kv file for better control
DONE    made a number of "control" class attributes in Board class      
DONE    added a progress bar below Score, works with the score, may alter the max amount with preference later
DONE    make progress bar work (you'd mentioned wanting to do this)
DONE    Add bubble to word complete to indicate how many points the word will give 
DONE   Clock of some sort 
DONE   animations? Possible delay for word slide - STARTED, needs a bit of work << FALON LIKES THE CHANGES AND THINK IT'S FINE
DONE   ability to shuffle the board, start new game(prompt for this.... but needs to be added later)  
DONE   Add animation to bubble
DONE   Add animation to score
DONE   new game/new level score threshhold for making it to next level - GOES WITH NEXT
DONE   something that keeps track of the high score (writes/reads from a separate file)
Done   Basic Game Over screen and score/high score display
Craig/Falon to help   Put in search word (just the longest word possible on the board at the time)

SO PRIORITY IS SEARCH WORD!!! THEN WE HAVE SOMETHING FOR DEMO THAT MEETS ALL SPECS... JUST CODE TIDYING THAT WILL NEED TO HAPPEN AFTERWARDS

Optional:
????     add anything to Gameover screen
????     changing theme/design colors and whatnot
Craig    (together?) word hint   
Craig?    revisit update_board to be more efficient, if possible (MEMOIZATION MAYBE??)
????      maybe some cheesy prize/reward for each time they level up or something- NOT REALLY INTO THIS IDEA ANYMORE
