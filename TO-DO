DONE    word length bonus         
DONE    dict include 3 letter words 
DONE    word completion or arrows or both (box positioning using pos_hint) NO ARROWS THOUGH... NOT NECESSARY(?)
DONE    randomization of letters and amount of vowels?(4:3, cons:vowel) (list of 	  combines letters in ratio to randomly choose from)
DONE    removing words
DONE    REMOVE RED THINGS!!!
DONE    changed rows to columns
DONE    added color to word hint, yellow is a partial word, green is a whole word
DONE    moved layout to .kv file for better control
DONE    made a number of "control" class attributes in Board class      
DONE    added a progress bar below Score, doesn't do anything yet
Craig   animations? Possible delay for word slide - STARTED, needs a bit of work
Craig   ability to shuffle the board, reset  
Craig   Put in search word (just the longest word possible on the board at the time)
Craig?  Add bubble to word complete to indicate how many points the word will give
Falon   Clock of some sort DOING THIS NEXT
Falon?  make progress bar work (you'd mentioned wanting to do this)
Falon?  new game/new level (score threshhold for making it to next level or failing) - GOES WITH PREVIOUS
Falon   what happens when lose/win how?? ---> do the timer countdown with +seconds for words done
????    something that keeps track of the high score (writes/reads from a separate file)


Optional:
????      changing theme/design colors and whatnot
Craig   (together?) word hint   
Craig?    revisit update_board to be more efficient, if possible (MEMOIZATION MAYBE??)
????      maybe some cheesy prize/reward for each time they level up or something

Changes:
    I played with the score assignment slightly (4 times more bonus for length). I figure we will be changing this
    more anyway once we have the levels and timer working.
